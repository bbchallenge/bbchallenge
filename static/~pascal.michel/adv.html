  <b> The methods used to find busy beavers</b>
 </font>
</p>

<p>
The machines presented in these pages were discovered by means of computer
programs. These programs contain procedures that achieve the following tasks:
<ol>
<li> To enumerate Turing machines without repetition.</li>
<li> To simulate Turing machines efficiently.</li>
<li> To recognize non-halting Turing machines.</li>
</ol>

Note that these procedures are often mixed together in
real programs, as follows: A tree of transition tables is generated,
and, as soon as some transitions are defined, the corresponding
Turing machine is simulated. If the definition of a new transition is necessary,
the tree is extended. If the computation seems to loop, a proof
of this fact is provided.



</p>

<p>
If the purpose is to prove a value for the busy beaver functions,
then all Turing machines in a class have to be studied. The machines
that pass through the three procedures above are either halting machines,
from which the better one is selected, or holdouts waiting for better
programs or for hand analyses.
</p>

<p>
If the purpose is to find lower bounds, a systematic enumeration
of machines is not necessary. Terry and Shawn Ligocki said they
used simulated annealing to find some of their machines.

  <b> Busy beavers and unprovability</b>
 </font>
</p>

<li>
<p>
Let S(n) = S(n,2) be Rado's busy beaver function. We know that S(2) = 6, S(3) = 21, S(4) = 107,
and we can hope to prove that S(5) = 47,176,870. As we will see below, the fact that
the busy beaver function S is not computable implies that it is not possible to prove
that, for any natural number n, S(n) has its true value.
</p>

<p>
Formally, we have the following theorem.
<blockquote>
<b>Theorem.</b> Let T be a well-known mathematical theory such as Peano arithmetic (PA)
or Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with axiom of choice (ZFC). Then there exist numbers
N and L such that S(N) = L, but the sentence &quot;S(N) = L&quot; is not provable in T.
</blockquote>

This theorem is an easy consequence of the following proposition.
<blockquote>
<b>Proposition.</b> Let T be a well-known mathematical theory such as PA or ZFC.
Then there exists a Turing machine with two symbols M that does not stop when
it is launched on a blank tape, but the fact that it does not stop is not provable in T.
</blockquote>
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<b>Proof of the theorem from the proposition.</b> Let M be the Turing machine given
by the proposition, let N be the number of states of M, and let L = S(N).
Then, to prove that &quot;S(N) = L&quot;, we have to prove that M does not stop.
But, by the proposition, such a proof does not exist.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<b>Proof of the proposition.</b> This proposition is well-known and a one line proof
can be given, as follows.
<blockquote>
If all non-halting machines were provably non-halting, then an algorithm that gives
simultaneously the computable enumeration of the halting machines and the computable
enumeration of the provably non-halting machines would solve the halting problem on
a blank tape.
</blockquote>
We give a detailed proof for nonspecialist readers.
</p>

<p>
Let M<sub>1</sub>, M<sub>2</sub>, . . . be a computably enumerable sequence of
all Turing machines with two symbols.<br>

Such a sequence can be obtained as follows: we list machines according to their
number of states, and, inside the set of machines with n states, we list
the machines according to the alphabetical order of their transition tables.<br>
</p>

<p>
Let T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2</sub>, . . . be a computably enumerable sequence of the
theorems of the theory T.<br>

The existence of such a sequence is the main requirement that theory T has to
satisfy in order that the proposition holds, and of course such a sequence exists
for well-known mathematical theories such as PA or ZFC.
</p>

<p>
Now consider the following algorithms A and B.
<blockquote>
<b>Algorithm A.</b> We launch the machines M<sub>i</sub> on the blank tape as follows:
<ul>
<li> one step of computation of M<sub>1</sub>,</li>
<li> 2 steps of computation of M<sub>1</sub>, 2 steps of computation of M<sub>2</sub>,</li> 
<li> 3 steps of computation of M<sub>1</sub>, 3 steps of computation of M<sub>2</sub>,
3 steps of computation of M<sub>3</sub>,</li>
<li> . . .
</ul>
When a machine M<sub>i</sub> stops, we add it to a list of machines that stop when
they are launched on a blank tape.
<p> </p>
Note that, given a machine M, by running Algorithm A we will know that M stops if
M stops, but we will never know that M doesn't stop if M doesn't stop.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Algorithm B.</b> We launch the algorithm that provides the computably enumerable
sequence of theorems of theory T, and each time we get a theorem T<sub>i</sub>,
we look and see if this is a theorem of the form &quot;The Turing machine M does not
stop when it is launched on a blank tape&quot;. If that is the case, we add
M to a list of Turing machines that provably do not stop on a blank tape.
<p> </p>
Note that, given a machine M, by running Algorithm B we will know that M is
provably non-halting if M is provably non-halting, but we will never know that M
is not provably non-halting if M is not provably non-halting.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Now we have two algorithms, A and B, and
<ul>
<li>
Algorithm A gives us a computably enumerable list of the Turing machines that stop
when they are launched on a blank tape.
<p> </p>
</li>
<li>
Algorithm B gives us a computably enumerable list of the Turing machines that
provably do not stop on a blank tape.
<p> </p>
</li>
</ul>

We mix together these two algorithms, by a procedure called dovetailing, to get
Algorithm C, as follows.
<blockquote>
<b>Algorithm C.</b>
<ul>
<li> one step of Algorithm A, one step of Algorithm B,</li>
<li> 2 steps of Algorithm A, 2 steps of Algorithm B,</li>
<li> 3 steps of Algorithm A, 3 steps of Algorithm B,</li>
<li> . . .
</ul>
</blockquote>

Algorithm C gives us simultaneously both the computably enumerable lists
provided by Algorithm A and Algorithm B.
</p>

<p>
So Algorithm C gives us both the list of halting Turing machines and the list of
provably non-halting Turing machines (on a blank tape).
</p>

<p>
Now we are ready to prove the proposition.<br>
If all non-halting Turing machines were provably non-halting, then Algorithm C
would give us the list of halting Turing machines and the list of non-halting
Turing machines (on a blank tape).
So, given a Turing machine M, by running Algorithm C, we would see M appearing
in one of the lists, and we could settle the halting problem for machine M
on a blank tape. So Algorithm C would give us a computable procedure to
settle the halting problem on a blank tape.
But it is known that such a computable procedure does not exist.
Thus, there exists a non-halting Turing machine that is not provably
non-halting on a blank tape.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Consider the Turing machine M given by the proposition: M does not stop when
it is launched on a blank tape, but this fact is not provable in theory T.
We can get an idea of what such a machine M looks like, as follows.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>
For example, M can be a machine that enumerates the theorems of theory T,
and stops when it finds a contradiction (such that 0 = 1 if T is Peano
arithmetic).
</p>

<p>
Then a proof within theory T that M does not stop would be a proof within
theory T of the consistency of T, which is impossible by G&ouml;del's
Second Incompleteness Theorem (if theory T is consistent).
</p>

<p>
This gives another proof of the proposition, a shorter one, but resting on
a big theorem.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p> Another example can be given using G&ouml;del's First Incompleteness Theorem.
If T is PA or ZFC, supposed to be consistent, the proof of this theorem provides
a formula F that asserts its own unprovability. Thus F is true, but
unprovable within theory T.
</p>

<p>
Consider the machine M that enumerates the theorems of theory T, and stops when
it finds formula F.
</p>

<p>
Machine M does not stop, since F is unprovable, but a proof that it does not stop
would be a proof that F is unprovable, so, since F <i><b>is</b></i> &quot;F is
unprovable&quot;, a proof of F, which is impossible, since F is unprovable. 
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
As a third example, consider the machine M that enumerates the theorems
of theory T (PA or ZFC, supposed to be consistent), and stops when it finds
a formula F that says that M itself does not stop. Such a machine can be proved
to exist by applying the Recursion Theorem to the function f such that
machine M<sub>f(x)</sub> stops if it finds a proof that machine M<sub>x</sub>
does not stop.
</p>

<p>
Then F is true, because, if F were false, then M would stop, so F would be
a theorem of T, so F would be true. But F is unprovable, because since F is true,
M does not stop, so F is not a theorem of theory T.
So the fact that M does not stop is true and unprovable.
</p>
</li>

</ul>

<p>
Note that, in these three examples of Turing machines M, the watched formulas
are more and more complicated, and the theorems used to prove that M suits
are more and more elementary.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Since May 2016, there are explicit constructions of Turing machines whose behaviors are independent of ZFC.
<p>

  <ul>
<li>    
  <p>
    Adam Yedidia and Scott Aaronson gave, in  May 2016, a Turing machine with 7910 states and two symbols
such that it cannot be proved in ZFC that it never halts.
They note that enumerating the theorems of ZFC would need a big number of states.
They use a graph theoretic statement that Harvey Friedman proved to be
equivalent to the consistency of a theory that implies the consistency of ZFC.
By using a new high-level language that is easily compiled down to Turing machine
description, they build a machine that would halt if it finds a counterexample
to Friedman's statement.

     S. O'Rear</a> improved the number of states to 1919, in September 2016. <br>
   He improved later the number of states to 748. <br>

</ul>
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Note that, if &quot;S(N) = L&quot; is a true sentence unprovable in theory T,
then, for all m &gt; L, &quot;S(N) &lt; m&quot; is also a true sentence unprovable
in theory T.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Note that the proposition  is a special case of the following more general theorem.
<blockquote>
<b>Theorem.</b> Let A be a set of natural numbers that is computably enumerable but not computable,
and let T be a well-known mathematical theory such as PA or ZFC. Then there exists
a natural number n such that the sentence &quot;n is not a member of A&quot; is
true but not provable in theory T.
</blockquote>
The proof of this theorem is the same as above:
if all natural numbers not in A were provably not in A,
then the simultaneous enumerations of A and of natural numbers provably not in A would give
a procedure that decides membership in A, contradicting the fact that A is not computable.
</p>

<p>
The proposition is gotten from this theorem by numbering the list of Turing machines,
and by defining A as the set of numbers of Turing machines that stop on a blank tape.
</p>
</li>

<li>
There is another proof of unprovability, based on Kolmogorov complexity.<br>
<p>
The Kolmogorov complexity of a number is the length of the shortest program
from which a universal Turing machine can output this number.
</p>

<p>
By Chaitin's Incompleteness Theorem, for any well-known mathematical
theory T, there exists a number n(T) such that, for all numbers of
complexity greater than n(T), the fact that they have complexity greater than
n(T) is true but unprovable within theory T.
</p>

<p>
Chaitin's theorem also applies to the complexity defined as follows:
The complexity of a number k is the smallest number n of states
of a Turing machine with n states and two symbols that outputs this number k,
written as a string of k symbols 1, when the machine is launched on a blank tape.
</p>

<p>
So there exists a number n(T) such that, for any number k of
complexity greater than n(T), the sentence &quot;the complexity of k is
greater than n(T)&quot; is true but unprovable within theory T.
But &quot;k &gt; Sigma(n(T))&quot; implies
&quot;the complexity of k is greater than n(T)&quot;,
so, for any number k &gt; Sigma(n(T)), &quot;k &gt; Sigma(n(T))&quot;
is true but unprovable within theory T.

  <b> Tables normalization</b>
 </font>
</p>

<p>
 A permutation of states, or a permutation of symbols,
does not change the behavior of a Turing machine.<br>
 Suppose you get two Turing machines, taking the same
time to stop on an initially blank tape. How to know
whether these machines are essentially different,
or they are just the same machine up to a permutation
of states or symbols?<br>
 To settle this problem, you can <b>normalize</b> the table,
putting it in <b>tree normal form (TNF)</b>.
</p>

<p>
 Since we are interested by the behaviors of Turing machines
on an initially blank tape, the simplest rule is the following one:
<blockquote>
 When the Turing machine is launched on a blank tape:
 <ul>
  <li>
   it enters states in the following order: A, B, C, ...
   <p> </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   it writes symbols in the following order: 0, 1, 2, ...
  </li>
 </ul>
</blockquote>

So, normally, the first transition is A0 --&gt; 1RB or A0 --&gt; 0RB.
</p>

<p>
 As an example, we give below the tables of the Turing
machines as found by Terry and Shawn Ligocki, and their
normalized versions as given in the present web pages.
